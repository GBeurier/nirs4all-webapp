**Global**
- App Icon
- Add nirs4all logo

**Dashboard**
- think it as settings more than dashboard or simply remove

**Settings**
- Configure correctly workspace
- Add space occupied / free space

**API**
- verify that if functions shouldn't go to nirs4all (ie. umap)


**Datasets**
Add drag n drop folder or files. Directly to create datasets, or into the dataset wizard.

**Pipeline Builder**
- REFACTOR THE COMPONENTS. LOT LOT LOT OF REDONDANCIES
- REVIEW PARAM WINDOWS > MANY COPIES AND USELESS DIVS

- Extend the number of generators to match all existings in nirs4all > advanced checker
- item in menu overlap except for chart oO ? reduce item width
- Operator for sequential (the eqiuvalent of "[" "]" in nirs4all) ?? still necessary ?
- Finetuning: Move 'best model training" in a separate tab > "training".
- Enhance drop zone at last place of nested list. It's difficult.
- Seed is misplaced. Shouldn't be in settings but somewhere else


**Pipelines**
- Update to see saved / presets / etc.


**Playground**
- operators all over (augmentations op in preprocessings)
- refresh when options are change make the app crash if option is empty. Refresh after enter or getting out with different value.

**Settings**
- Add chinese
- Remove animation do not work (it's actually worse)
- Unify / clean / specify / distinguish nirs4all workspaces and app settings folder.
