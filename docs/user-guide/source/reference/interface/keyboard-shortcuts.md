# Keyboard Shortcuts

nirs4all Studio provides keyboard shortcuts for efficient navigation, especially within the Pipeline Editor. On macOS, use the Command key; on Windows and Linux, use Ctrl instead.

## Pipeline Editor shortcuts

| {kbd}`Right Arrow` | Navigate into a branch (expand) |
| {kbd}`Left Arrow` | Navigate out of a branch (collapse / go to parent) |
| {kbd}`Enter` | Open configuration panel for the selected step |
| {kbd}`Escape` | Deselect current step or close dialogs |

### Panels

| Shortcut | Action |
|----------|--------|
| {kbd}`Tab` | Cycle focus to the next panel (Palette, Tree, Config) |
| {kbd}`Shift+Tab` | Cycle focus to the previous panel |
| {kbd}`Ctrl+K` | Open the command palette |
| {kbd}`Ctrl+?` | Show the keyboard shortcuts dialog |

### Editing

| {kbd}`Ctrl+D` | Duplicate the selected step |
| {kbd}`Delete` or {kbd}`Backspace` | Delete the selected step |

## Command palette

The command palette ({kbd}`Ctrl+K`) provides quick access to any action or node in the Pipeline Editor. Start typing to filter commands and press Enter to execute.

The command palette works even when your cursor is inside an input field, making it a reliable way to switch tasks quickly.

## General application shortcuts

Standard browser and desktop shortcuts also work throughout the application:

| Shortcut | Action |
|----------|--------|
| {kbd}`Ctrl+Plus` / {kbd}`Ctrl+Minus` | Browser zoom in / zoom out |
| {kbd}`F11` | Toggle full-screen mode (desktop) |
| {kbd}`Ctrl+R` | Refresh the page |

## Viewing shortcuts in the app

You can view all available keyboard shortcuts at any time from within the Pipeline Editor:

1. Press {kbd}`Ctrl+?` to open the shortcuts dialog.
2. Shortcuts are organized by category: Navigation, Panels, Editing, and Actions.

The shortcuts dialog also appears as a reference card in **Settings > General > Keyboard Shortcuts**.
