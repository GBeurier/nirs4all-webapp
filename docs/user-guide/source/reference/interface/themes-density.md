# Themes and Display

nirs4all Studio offers several display settings to customize the application appearance and layout density. All settings are found under **Settings > General > Appearance**.

## Theme

Choose between three theme options:

| Theme | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| **Light** | A bright interface with a white background. Good for well-lit environments. |
| **Dark** | A dark interface with muted backgrounds. Reduces eye strain in low-light environments. |
| **System** | Automatically follows your operating system's theme preference. When your OS switches between light and dark mode, the application follows. |

The application uses a teal/cyan color accent throughout all themes. Charts, buttons, and highlights maintain consistent coloring regardless of which theme you choose.

## Display density

Display density controls how much spacing appears between elements in the interface. This affects padding, margins, and text size across all pages.

| Density | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Compact** | Minimal spacing. Fits more information on screen. Best for experienced users who want maximum data density. |
| **Comfortable** | Balanced spacing (default). A good middle ground for most users and screen sizes. |
| **Spacious** | Extra spacing between elements. Easier to read and click, especially on touch screens or high-resolution displays. |

## Zoom level

Independent of display density, you can adjust the overall zoom level of the application interface. Available zoom levels are:

**75%**, **80%**, **90%**, **100%** (default), **110%**, **125%**, **150%**

Lowering the zoom level lets you see more content at once, while increasing it makes text and controls larger and easier to read.

```{tip}
Zoom level and display density work together. For example, you can use Compact density with 110% zoom to get tight spacing but larger text.
```

## Animations

The **Reduce Animations** toggle lets you minimize or disable transition animations throughout the application. When enabled:

- Page transitions are instant rather than animated.
- Cards and panels appear without fade or slide effects.
- Charts render without entrance animations.

This is useful if you prefer a snappier interface, experience motion sensitivity, or are working on a lower-powered device.

## Language

nirs4all Studio supports multiple interface languages. The language selector is located in the Appearance section of the General settings tab. Changing the language updates all menus, labels, and interface text immediately.

## Where to find these settings

1. Click **Settings** in the sidebar (at the bottom).
2. The **General** tab is selected by default.
3. The **Appearance** card contains theme, density, zoom, animation, and language controls.
