# Predictions Page

The **Predictions** page stores and manages all prediction results generated by your experiments. Each entry represents a set of predictions made by a trained model on a dataset. From here you can review per-sample values, compare metrics, and export data for external use.

## Predictions table

The main table lists every stored prediction set in the active workspace.

### Columns

| Column | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Dataset** | Name of the dataset the predictions were made on. |
| **Model** | Name and configuration of the model that produced the predictions. |
| **Date** | Timestamp of when the prediction was generated. |
| **Samples** | Total number of samples in the prediction set. |
| **R2** | Coefficient of determination for the prediction set (regression tasks). |
| **RMSE** | Root-mean-square error (regression tasks). |
| **Accuracy** | Classification accuracy (classification tasks only). |

:::{note}
Metric columns adapt to the task type. Regression predictions show R2 and RMSE; classification predictions show Accuracy and F1 score.

### Sorting and filtering

- Click any column header to sort by that column. Click again to reverse the sort direction.
- Use the **search bar** at the top to filter by dataset name or model name.
- Use the **date range** filter to limit results to a specific time period.

## Row actions

Each row in the predictions table provides a set of actions accessible via the actions menu on the right side of the row.

| Action | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **View details** | Opens the prediction detail panel showing per-sample results. |
| **Export CSV** | Downloads the full prediction set as a comma-separated values file. |
| **Export Excel** | Downloads the prediction set as an Excel workbook (`.xlsx`). |
| **Delete** | Permanently removes the prediction set from the workspace. A confirmation dialog appears before deletion. |

:::{tip}
You can select multiple rows using the checkboxes on the left and then use the bulk actions toolbar to export or delete several prediction sets at once.

## Prediction detail panel

Clicking **View details** (or clicking the row itself) opens a detail panel that displays the full per-sample prediction table.

### Per-sample columns

| Column | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Sample** | Sample index or identifier from the dataset. |
| **Predicted** | The value predicted by the model for this sample. |
| **Actual** | The true reference value from the dataset. |
| **Residual** | Difference between predicted and actual values (`Predicted - Actual`). |
| **Fold** | The cross-validation fold this sample belonged to during evaluation (if applicable). |

### Detail panel controls

| Control | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Search** | Filter the sample table by sample identifier. |
| **Sort** | Click any column header to sort the sample list. Sorting by absolute residual is useful for finding the worst predictions. |
| **Scatter plot** | A compact predicted-vs-actual scatter plot is displayed above the table, with the 1:1 diagonal reference line. |

---

## Export formats

Exported prediction files contain all per-sample data plus summary metadata in the header.

| Format | Contents |
|--------|----------|
| **CSV** | Plain text, comma-delimited. First rows contain metadata comments (model name, dataset, date). Subsequent rows contain Sample, Predicted, Actual, and Residual columns. |
| **Excel** | Multi-sheet workbook. The first sheet contains summary metrics. The second sheet contains the full per-sample table. |

Exported files are saved to the `exports/` directory inside your active workspace folder.

## How predictions are stored

Predictions are saved automatically at the end of each experiment run that includes an evaluation step. They are stored in the workspace database (`store.duckdb`) and linked to the originating run, model, and dataset. Deleting a prediction set does not affect the trained model or the original run history.
