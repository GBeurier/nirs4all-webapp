# How-To Guides

These practical guides show you how to accomplish specific tasks in nirs4all Studio. Unlike tutorials, each guide focuses on a single task and assumes you already know the basics.

## Data Management

- {doc}`datasets/import-csv` — Import a CSV dataset
- {doc}`datasets/import-excel` — Import Excel files (.xlsx, .xls)
- {doc}`datasets/import-matlab` — Import MATLAB .mat files
- {doc}`datasets/import-folder` — Import a folder structure with drag-and-drop
- {doc}`datasets/batch-scan` — Scan a directory for multiple datasets at once
- {doc}`datasets/organize-groups` — Create and manage dataset groups
- {doc}`datasets/edit-config` — Edit dataset configuration (targets, parsing)
- {doc}`datasets/inspect-data` — Explore spectra, targets, and raw data

## Pipelines

- {doc}`pipelines/create-pipeline` — Create a pipeline from scratch
- {doc}`pipelines/use-preset` — Start from a built-in preset
- {doc}`pipelines/add-preprocessing` — Add preprocessing steps (SNV, SG, etc.)
- {doc}`pipelines/add-model` — Add a model step (PLS, Random Forest, etc.)
- {doc}`pipelines/add-splitter` — Add cross-validation splitters
- {doc}`pipelines/use-branching` — Create parallel pipeline branches
- {doc}`pipelines/use-generators` — Use parameter sweeps and alternatives
- {doc}`pipelines/import-export` — Import and export pipelines as JSON
- {doc}`pipelines/manage-library` — Organize your pipeline library

## Experiments

- {doc}`experiments/launch-experiment` — Launch an experiment with the wizard
- {doc}`experiments/monitor-progress` — Monitor a running experiment in real time
- {doc}`experiments/stop-experiment` — Stop a running experiment

## Results

- {doc}`results/view-scores` — View performance scores by dataset
- {doc}`results/compare-chains` — Compare pipeline configurations
- {doc}`results/aggregated-results` — View aggregated results across runs
- {doc}`results/export-predictions` — Export predictions to CSV

## Exploration

- {doc}`explore/playground-basics` — Use the Playground for interactive preprocessing
- {doc}`explore/compare-steps` — Compare preprocessing steps side by side
